# Osmand Quick Actions

This project contains some presets of quick actions for Osmand. This presets are mainly focused on contributing to OpenStreetMap by addind POI directly in Osmand.

## Presets

- Hike: create POI during a hike: viewpoint, guidepost, spring, etc.
- Indonesia:
  - Village: water well, water tower, kiosk, etc.
  - City: mosque, church, restaurant, etc.
- Trees: mainly fruits trees of Europe and others trees that I like to add to the map

## How to

2. Open the "osf" file from phone file manager
3. Phone should propose you to import the file in Osmand
4. In Osmand, check the import checkbox
